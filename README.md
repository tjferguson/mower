#General Information

The purpose of this project is to turn a bunch of ardiuno + FPV electronics into a fully functional FPV lawn mower capable of handling my side lawn; this particular lawn happens to have between a 15 and 30% grade in different areas, and as evidenced by the missing tip of my right grand toe, is fairly dangerous to mow.
